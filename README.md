Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on the Titanic dataset as part of my Data Analyst Internship at Elevate Labs.

ðŸ§  Objective
To understand the factors influencing passenger survival in the Titanic dataset through statistical and visual analysis using Python.

ðŸ“¦ Files Included

Titanic_EDA_Task.ipynb â€“ Jupyter notebook with full code and visualizations
Titanic_EDA_Report_Final.pdf â€“ PDF summary of findings
README.md â€“ Documentation for this project


ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

ðŸ“Š EDA Process
âœ… Step 1: Data Loading & Overview
Loaded train.csv from Kaggle Titanic competition
Checked shape, column types, and missing values

âœ… Step 2: Data Cleaning
Filled missing values in Age and Embarked
Dropped Cabin due to excessive nulls
Created new feature: FamilySize = SibSp + Parch + 1

âœ… Step 3: Univariate Analysis
Analyzed distributions of age, fare, gender, class
Found most passengers were male and in 3rd class

âœ… Step 4: Bivariate Analysis
Compared survival with gender, class, and embarkation point
Found women and 1st class passengers had higher survival

âœ… Step 5: Multivariate Analysis
Used heatmap and pairplots to study feature correlations
Fare, Pclass, and FamilySize were related to survival


ðŸ’¡ Key Findings
Sex: Females had a much higher survival rate (~75%)
Pclass: 1st class passengers survived more than 2nd and 3rd
Family Size: 2â€“4 member families had better survival
Fare: Higher fare linked to higher survival
Age: Children had slightly better chances


ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations Used
Countplots
Histograms with KDE
Boxplots
Violin plots
Heatmaps
Pairplots


âœ… Conclusion
This EDA task demonstrated how to:


Clean and analyze real-world data
Use visualizations to communicate findings
Prepare data for modeling
